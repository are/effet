# effet
A bunch of libraries inspired by declarative and functional programming that compose with each other nicely (tho can be used separately).

## [@effet/core](packages/core)

> Declarative, functional and manageable side-effects with decent error handling

## [@effet/contract](packages/contract)

> Small, lightweight contracts for validating values, native to Javascript.
